Welcome to Grubs!

Grubs is a spatially discrete particle based cellular automaton.
Spatially discrete means that it occurs on a grid, and particle based means that the cells are treated as persistent entities.
Each cell attempts to cooperate with other cells it shares genetic similarity with, and compete with those it does not.
The environment may appear chaotic at first, but once it settles down you will see distinct organisms emerge and try to survive.
